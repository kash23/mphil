In summary, we have produced a family of graphs which are slow for graph isomorphism solvers. We have provided a program which generates these graphs at random, satisfying attributes of no non-trivial automorphisms and resistance to vertex colour refinement algorithms. Generally, in contrast to graphs of equivalent size, our construction was slow running. 

\section[Further Work]{Further Work}
In extending our work, we suggest improving the algorithm to find our construction more efficiently. There are numerous ways in which difficult instances could be located. With an improved algorithm, there will undoubtedly arise much more complex systems.
